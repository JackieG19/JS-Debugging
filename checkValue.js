/* Note: JavaScript consoles is known as DevTools, for debugging JavaScript.

The console.log() method, which "prints" the output of what is within its 
parentheses to the console, will likely be the most helpful debugging tool. 

Placing it at strategic points in your code can show the intermediate values of variables. 
It gives an idea of what the output should be before looking at what it is. 
Having check points throughout your code will help narrow down where the problem is.*/
